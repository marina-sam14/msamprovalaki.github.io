## About Me

My name is Marina and I am currently pursuing my MSc in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Ion Androutsopoulos](https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/). My research centers on Multimodal Large Language Models and their applications in the biomedical field, particularly in Diagnostic Captioning. I am especially interested in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and exploring how Generative AI can enhance model robustness.

Additionally, I am an active member of the [Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/theses.html) at AUEB, where we engage in research on NLP and Machine Learning.


## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Image Captioning, Object Detection, Video Captioning
- **Natural Language Processing:** Large Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, Text Generation, Alignment with Human Preference
- **Deep Learning**: Multimodal Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks


## News

- **[Oct. 2023]** My thesis in under the final review and will be available soon in the NLP Groupâ€™s [website](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr)
